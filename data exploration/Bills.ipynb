(iii) A person may not claim a credit on behalf of a deceased individual. No individual may claim a credit under this section for any year in a disallowance period under Title 26 U.S.C. Sec. 32(k)(1) of the internal revenue code or for any year for which the individual is ineligible to claim the credit in Title 26 U.S.C. Sec. 32 of the internal revenue code by reason of Title 26 U.S.C. Sec. 32(k)(2) of the internal revenue code. (b) The department shall protect the privacy and confidentiality of personal data of refund recipients in accordance with chapter 82.32 RCW.

This includes establishing a date by which applications will be accepted, with the aim of accepting applications as soon as possible. (7) The department must review the application and determine eligibility for the working families\\' tax credit based on information provided by the applicant and through audit and other administrative records, including, when it deems it necessary, verification through internal revenue service data. (8) If, upon review of internal revenue service data or other information obtained by the department, it appears that an individual received a refund that the individual was not entitled to, or received a larger refund than the individual was entitled to, the department may assess against the individual the overpaid amount. The department may also assess such overpaid amount against the individual\\'s spouse if the refund in question was based on both spouses filing a joint federal income tax return for the year for which the refund was claimed. (a) Interest as provided under RCW 82.32.050 applies to assessments authorized under this subsection (8) starting six months after the date the department issued the assessment until the amount due under this subsection (8) is paid in full to the department. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, penalties may not be assessed on amounts due under this subsection. (b) If an amount due under this subsection is not paid in full by the date due, or the department issues a warrant for the collection of amounts due under this subsection, the department may assess the applicable penalties under RCW 82.32.090 . Penalties under this subsection (8)(b) may not be made due until six months after the department\\'s issuance of the assessment. (c) If the department finds by clear, cogent, and convincing evidence that an individual knowingly submitted, caused to be submitted, or consented to the submission of, a fraudulent claim for refund under this section, the department must assess a penalty of 50 percent of the overpaid amount. This penalty is in addition to any other applicable penalties assessed in accordance with (b) of this subsection (8). (9) If, within the period allowed for refunds under RCW 82.32.060 , the department finds that an individual received a lesser refund than the individual was entitled to, the department must remit the additional amount due under this section to the individual. (10) Interest does not apply to refunds provided under this section. (11) Chapter 82.32 RCW applies to the administration of this section. NEW SECTION. Â\\xa0Â Sec. 2.
